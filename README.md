## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

This is the first project I've done using Bootstrap. I learned that I don't like Bootstrap. üòÖ
But seriously- I do understand the appeal of Bootstrap. All of the built in stuff can really save time. I just felt that in the time it took to look up classes in the docs,
I could have just added all the styles from scratch.
I really appreciated the tabbed section and the accordion section available in the docs. Although I do think I would have been able to make those from scratch, this time
using the pre-written content saved me time.

### Continued development

I could definitely put in more work to have the page match the original design. I decided not to because I felt that overriding all of Bootstrap's features/components would
negate the purpose of this entire assignment (which is to learn Bootstrap.) 
Also- I absolutely did not understand how to use breakpoints, so I just wrote my own. üòÅ
I'm not sure if I want to continue learning Bootstrap in the future or pivot to Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap documentation about breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints) - This is for my future reference.
- [Learn Bootstrap in Less Than 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eow125xV5-c) - This is an inspiring video for anyone who wants to get started with Bootstrap.
