## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- React


### What I learned

This is my most complex React project yet. This time I structured my files differently, and I think it made it a lot more manageable. I also learned a lot about when to put things in functions, when to pass info to components, and when to use hooks. Basic React stuff, I know, but it feels good to further solidify my knowledge.

### Continued development

This project has 2 pages, so I used React Router. I think in the future I want to learn how to work with Router better. Actually, this project was probably doable without Router.
I used a lot of conditional rendering. I think for a project this small, it was ok, but I think some areas could have been better handled with a different approach.
